// This header primarily exists in order to make compiling against code that
// expects OpenSSL easier. We have merged this header into <openssl/x509.h>.
// However, due to conflicts, some deprecated symbols are defined here.

// Deprecated constants.

// The following constants are legacy aliases for |X509v3_KU_*|. They are
// defined here instead of in <openssl/x509.h> because NSS's public headers use
// the same symbols. Some callers have inadvertently relied on the conflicts
// only being defined in this header.
