/// A container for hybrid public key encryption (HPKE) operations.
///
/// Hybrid public key encryption (HPKE) uses a symmetric encryption algorithm to encrypt data, and encapsulates the symmetric
/// encryption material using a public key encryption algorithm.
///
/// HPKE ensures that the ciphertext wasn't tampered with after its creation. It can also check the validity
/// of additional cleartext data in apps where you need to send headers or other metadata as cleartext.
///
/// HPKE optionally incorporates sender authentication, allowing the recipient to validate the authenticity of
/// messages using the sender's public key.
///
/// HPKE is described in the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) document
/// [RFC 9180](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc9180.pdf).
///
/// ## Topics
